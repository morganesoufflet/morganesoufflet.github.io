I am currently a second-year master student in the School of research at Sciences Po Paris. 
This website is currently under construction and will be updated soon.

I recently co-authored a Policy Brief at the Kiel Institute for the World Economy, 
you can find it on their website at https://www.ifw-kiel.de/publications/green-signals-energy-efficiency-and-german-housing-markets-33483/.
